# Archive Folder

This folder contains experimental templates, designs, and code that were created during development but are not currently being used in the main application.

## Contents

- `new_index.html`, `new_design.html`: Alternative UI designs for the application
- `multi_video_backend.py`: Experimental backend code for handling multiple video uploads
- `multi_video_fields.html`: Experimental HTML for multiple video file metadata fields
- `new_ui_design.html`: Another UI design experiment
- `fixed_index.html`: Modified version of the index page

These files are kept for reference and may contain useful ideas for future development, but should not be included in the main application workflow.
