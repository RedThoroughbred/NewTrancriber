Good for it. Okay, so when we, we're going to convert over to using OEM assembly to make car part plus enter change. And this is, this, these changes that I'm going to show you here are due to us switching over and what has to be done in our when we're mapping OEM assembly data from now on. So OEM assembly managing multiple motor names to enhance car part plus interchange. So the way that we've done with that we've made the car part plus interchange in the past is we would pick a name, a name that motor uses for a part. And then that which is the Aces parts names. And we would say, okay, if we want to produce interchange for AC hoses, we would turn on the one we would go to the part code called AC refrigerant suction hose AC refrigerant liquid hose and AC refrigerant discharge hose. And we would for those parts, we would map them to a car part code. In the case here, it's 683.23 and 4 represents those three Aces parts names. And then we just simply would go to the motor data and say everything that has been assigned that name by motor any of those three names. We're going to export those. They separate things out by position in motor. So they'll have AC refrigerant hoses under the position name of rear or front or right or left. And I was able to say in certain cases if I if there was a certain position that they had labeled something as and it what it didn't meet the spec of what we were trying to do. And I could say don't include if it's that position will include it, which in some cases we would do that that was pretty bad in the very beginning because they were terrible about having things that having their data under the wrong name. I remember when we first made the car part plus energy, we had exterior door handles and they had included the interior door handles in with the exterior door handles. So any and they had a position called enter for the exterior door handle. So I simply went into this mapping that I'm showing you here. And I said don't include if it's if it's in a position of inner, don't include it. And that that got us to phase one of making car part interchange and that that's pretty good, but it still was reliant on them marking that inner one as a position of enter. And we know how they're not too consistent about that kind of stuff. So you could have still got bad names or bad records in there, which we've seen. So the other problem with this whole method I'm showing you here is if we are 100% relying on the name that they have given to a part. And you guys that have done this, oh, we are assembling mapping. No, as you go through those that it's not consistent. They can they can have a part name and it can represent several different kinds of what we would consider other parts, not not the name they given it. Now that was one of the main reasons that we started mapping, we have assembly data in the beginning was just to go in, reinforce, you know, map what is this part and map it to what it is, give it a proper name. And that has been very, very successful. In my opinion, it's probably one of the most valuable mappings that we have. And it seems to always help us whenever we start different projects, you know, it always falls back on that we are assembly that makes the product better because we put that work into it. So it's a really valuable mapping and it's going to help now with the car part plus interchange because we don't have to now we don't have to depend on their names for parts. We can depend on the names we've given the part. So the new way this is just a simple flow chart to kind of describe the path that we would take to use the OEM assembly data to make the car part plus interchange. So starting on the top left where it says we have a gen 5 record that has an OEM number in a part name manufacturer things like that. So it's just a gen 5 data record they've given us. So the first thing we'll do is we'll go to the OEM assembly table and say, okay, for, you know, this OEM number part name manufacturer, have we got that map in the OEM assembly? Yes or no. If we don't have it mapped, it's simply ignored. We'll just fall down to this one on the bottom left here and it's not going to get written. So a requirement for car part plus interchange going forward is it has to be something we've mapped in OEM assembly. Okay, so when we find the record and it's mapped, then we get we have a when you map those parts in the assembly, we assign a child and a parent for the child we call a component part. So the component part has a car part code associated with it. This example is 332.1. So we take that 332.1 and we simply chop off everything that's to the right or the decimal point we go with a 332. So that record is now to us a 332 and a 332 is a, you know, pie for something like that, I'll figure out what it is. Whatever it is. Okay, so now we take that record and we put it in a table called CPOE interchange, which is just like a master table when we process the Gen 5 motor data, we process everything that they give us and we put it into a table called CPOE interchange, which is in the format that resembles a app record from Honda. It has a lot of the same components that make up an app record, you know, start here in dear apart a part code when we know it. And even if it doesn't, if we haven't mapped it in the OEM assembly, it's still going to go through all the processing and be put in this table and it just wouldn't have a Honda part code associated with it, but what still be there. And we apply a lot of logic to that data when we're processing it to make it look like interchange, you know, we'll take, they give us codes for everything. So if it was the leaders on an engine or the CID or if they give us a trim level, there's processing behind that that kind of formulates it to look like Honda type interchange so that when our customers see it, they kind of, they're used to, they see something they're used to. So we try to make it as close as possible so every GM5 record we process goes through that whole process. And then the, the new part here is where I've plugged in now a, a new couple actually two tables within the cache, so it would be unlike the ICDF2012 machine or ICDFD, whatever we're working right now. It's just on D because I'm still finishing it up, but basically I can go in now and I'll be able to say I want to make interchange for everything that has a 332 part code. So that means when we were mapping an OEM assembly, we may have mapped a couple of different names to make up that part name, 332. It might have been an exhaust pipe and it might have been an exhaust tip, you know, they might have had to use two different names for what we would call the same part. We'll say it was an exhaust tip and they, they called it two different names, but to us, it still means it's just a 332 dot whatever, which is to us would be in this case an exhaust tailpipe tip. So if I said I want to spit out all the interchange in our mode from our motor table that is a 332 interchange record, and I can just simply go and turn that on. And I did it in a way so that we can going forward, we have the, we'll have the potential to supplement the Hollander interchange. So for example, if Mitsubishi, you know, cut off, I don't know if the gear cut off was for that, but back in early 2000s, maybe let's say it was 2002. So there's nothing after 2002. I could go in and mark things like vendors and hoods and say, just start writing the inter just include the car part interchange from 2003 up for Mitsubishi. So all the Mitsubishi could get this interchange car part plus interchange. So we're trying to thank you know, father in advance to where we can switching over to this and then adding some more parts is going to be what I guess would be classified as phase two plus the part about where we do the automatic and manual remark part of it. But even going forward to maybe face of like a phase three, we could we could supplement the interchange with our interchange use what Hollander has and add on to it. So any any questions on that so far. I hope that kind of makes it clear that how it's different from what we've done in the past and what we're going to do going forward. I think this is a really good move. One another thing that I didn't mention that it really, really impacts is you've probably heard me say we have this problem where a motor will write interchange or will have data for bumper cover and within that part code of bumper cover they'll define whether it's for the front of the rear and they do that with that position field. So that created a problem for us and phase one all of the parts that we wrote car part plus interchange for was parts that that that didn't have that type of problem where they had one part code and we had several you know two or more part codes that would represent that. So using the so we have assembly mapping solves that problem because now when we go in a map bumper cover and the only assembly table we're picking you know we map all the front bumper covers and we map them to a front bumper cover part code which is a 101 and then we map all the rears to a 187 dot something. So now when we go to export if I said I wanted to export out bumper covers I could I could export out 101 separate from the 187s and make interchange for it. Excuse me separately so it solves that problem so they're switching over to this method is a big step forward in my opinion. So any any questions. So here's an example of how motor will map things are they will write their data for the same part under two different names in this case here they have the for this OEM number that I've got listed up in the top here. For this Cadillac 2008 SRX they have the so we have number and they've called it two different things they have it under two different aces parts name this is our current data so it's it's a problem they've had since they won and I complained about it since they won and they had they went through they called it a. They called it a. Positioning they had a project just for this type of problem where they know they have multiple they have. Parks listed under multiple names and they don't want that happen either they they're not proud of that but it's kind of a byproduct of the history of them making this data you know it's just through the through time has made its way up through you know. The catalog form in the beginning to electronic form in the legacy data and then now into this in five data but it's a problem that you know when you're in a in a book years ago when you're looking at stuff like this you might see it listed under they might have two different categories in the book and they listed in those places. And that that causes problems when we try to do what we do so in this case here there's two records with for the same part now if we were to export this out if we will say we had this mapped in OEM assembly both of these parts and if I said okay I want to make interchange for exhaust pipe tips and I export that out then this three thirty two if you looked in the down to bottom here that the Africa would get. This is how it would formulate that data you'd have two different records that have the same exact interchange number but two different descriptions when really it's the same part you know we in OEM assembly we we take this part and we look at the picture and we say oh well that's a exhaust so this exhaust tailpipe going forward we need to to not map that we would map it to what it is it's an exhaust tailpipe tip not to tell pipe we only map it in one spot now the problem is that we don't have to do that. Now the problem is how do you identify that when you're mapping so that's part of what I want to show you and going forward I did put this update out yesterday and I went through it with Mindy and I showed her how you identify the stuff and it's basically when you're this is a just a screen capture from the OEM assembly mapping form if you notice over on the right there's a column and this is where the part type ID so if you were working on both of these. The other part of our exhaust tailpipe tip and the name it's constantly looking to see is this OEM number found in any other part come terminology name or ACEs parts name is there any other part ACEs parts name for this part and if it finds one or more two or more then it turns that group red like a group is everything and green here that means it's the same. All within the same part family it's just a superseded number and it's looking at that group and saying is there more than one ACEs parts name for that OEM number in this group and if it is it makes this red that tiny identified so what do you do then. You can right click and I put a new menu choice in here display additional part terminology data and when you click that it'll bring up this form that shows you the two different places that this thing is used in this case here they used it under two different part terminology IDs I was working on you know 10,000 and 23 but they also have a list of under 14,907 and I can see here that it's mapped in both of these. So back to this record here when we spit out interchange we would get exactly what it shows at the bottom of the page there so I need to fix that so I added a mechanism where you simply can double click on the one that you don't that you want to edit so in this case here. Actually I should have done it on the other one if I wanted to save it as a it's off tailpipe tip then I can go in and I can just exclude the record that I don't want I exclude is something we have it done in the OEM assembly to date I did do a check on that and there was one record in there that was marked as exclude that I think somebody just hit the button for on button it was really should have been a skip. So I picked that so going forward I want to you I wanted to find the exclude as we have looked at this part and found that it's used in multiple places and the one that I'm excluding we don't we don't ever want to map this one we're just going to skip over that if we were mapping in that area of where that one is excluded that same basis part name thing we just would not fix that we would leave that as excluded. And that is making the assumption that it's still read and showing in more than one spot i'm not saying that they maybe they could fix some of the stuff and and it might be marked as exclude and it might not be read and if you see that case you might want to investigate that because maybe now we've. We got one place to map it to get it to show up in the in the car part plus interchange. So you can you can edit from this form exclude the one you want to get rid of. And that's it. Move on to the next part. Does that make sense to everybody and do you have any questions on how to use that. Well that's good i must have done my job well or. When you don't is it not does it turn the red some other color you have to re refresh to do that. Now it'll it's always going to stay red. Even if you market excluded because it's it's just got a simple rule behind it that says for this record that I'm or this. OEM number are there any other names for it in motor data and it since that case would still exist it's still going to stay red. Well you I guess my concern is that you don't want somebody re coming back a week later or someone else looking at it and say this one needs to be looked at when. Truly it already has been looked at is there a way to flag it to say you don't need to bother looking at this. Well typically the the things that we come back to we only come back to when we process new data and if something is already mapped it would be really no need to look at that one again you don't. You can only be looking for the things that are not mapped at all and that's the ones that you would go through and target fixing or you know mapping so I don't think that it you know I can't see. A reason why you come back in here be going through these again. Hey yeah I don't know anything I could think of as if it's a supersede that would be a different record than wouldn't. If it's a supersede it automatically gets put in that group and map to the same thing that all the other parts are mapped to a network. Yeah but the one you the one you excluded is not no longer the same OEM number so I guess I'm wondering does the exclusion follow the new part number. It is still the same OEM number. So when you even when you exclude this OEM number in that other cart name it that's part of a group in itself so you know I mean I guess logically it would have the same OEM numbers in the group for both of their names and when you excluded it excludes everything in that group. You don't you know it's not just that one OEM number so everything in that group that has that part name. Oh so you're you're excluding the name not not the number. Yep. And ultimately what that what you're excluding is you're you're eliminating the possibility that that record will get exported out to our motor application file you know interchange application file. That's ultimately what you're doing. Any other questions? Yeah I have a question. I've I've been doing this now some yesterday and I'm working on the AC Hoses and so I'm finding a lot in here because they're kind of all over the place. So I'm working on the discharge hose but I'm finding suction houses and liquid houses. So I guess my question is if I'm finding it because we are we are going to also be mapping the section in the liquid. And I'm finding it under those names so it would correctly be mapped under it's under a discharge house but it should be a liquid house. So can I go ahead and map it? Yeah I want to map it just by the picture. By the picture in the definitions. Okay so the picture it'll say discharge hose but the name of the part of suction hose. Well, I'll actually say liquid I don't know these houses are all over the place. They're just all mixed up. So I think I'll make that. Is it true that you can technically use the same hose for different purposes or is there some kind of mechanism inside the house that makes them different? I'm wondering if I mean sometimes on AC Hoses the two will be integrated together by some you know manifold that you can have two different hoses but they you can't take them apart. So they're made together. I'm wondering if that might be the case for those what I might have to take a look at those Mindy and see if there's some kind of special consideration we need to make there. I'm not sure I can answer that one. I'll talk about it without seeing the example. Okay. Actually I'm. What's the can you give me a or criminology ID to look at? What the number is. Yes I'll see if I can pull one of these up. One three five two eight. AC refrigerant discharge hose. And then which position? I don't have an exact one up right now. I didn't realize it was going to be. Okay. All right. That's fine. I can train find them really quick but. If this quick I won't hold it by a prevent. I just thought you might have one of them. Your head there or something. Okay. So we'll work together. We'll figure that out and then we'll communicate that answer back to everyone else so they know the interest. Any other questions? If you got a way of exporting out those ones we've suppressed and you could directly send them to. Motor and say. The ones you need to fix. Good. That's a good idea. I don't but it would be easy enough to make something like that. Yeah. I think they would help us both out. Yeah. And they might see a pattern of what they're doing wrong. You know. Hopefully get them to fix it. Yeah. They, one of the reports that they send every time we get data from them. One of the reports is they actually list accounts of duplicate where they know they have duplicates. And that number. It does in the beginning when they first, you know, had that project going where they were really targeting the stuff that went down a lot in the beginning but it seems like it's. Maybe they've got it to a point where they're okay with what's left. I don't know if this is like it's going down as much as it used to but maybe if we start complaining about it then might get them going on again. Yeah. And now I wonder about new people coming in. Do they understand, you know, the problem is every time you get a new person in, you know, that could make the numbers go up again. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great idea. Okay. Well, that concludes today's show.
